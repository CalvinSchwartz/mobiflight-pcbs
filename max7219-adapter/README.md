# MobiFlight MAX7219 Adapter Board
The MobiFlight MAX7219 Adapter Board is for those users who have bought the conventional MAX7219 PCBs with the 2x4 digits (e.g., from eBay) and would like to continue using them with this adapter.
The adapter mounts directly to the green original PCBs and uses the MAX7219 chip and provides two sockets that can be used with the MobiFlight MAX7219 PCBs (more information and [pictures also available in the shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/max7219-breakout-adapter)).
