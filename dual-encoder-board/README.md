# Dual encoder board

The dual encoder board was created because the commonly available and most affordable, and thus most popular 
dual encoder for cockpit building does not have threads on the shaft, and it is thus hard to mount on panels 
without using a printed circuit board.

The encoder board features a soldering footprint for the encoder as well as two JST XH connectors that let you
attach the encoder for example to a [MobiFlight Cube adapter](https://github.com/MobiFlight/mobiflight-pcbs/tree/main/cube-adapter) 
with a 4 pin JST XH cable.

The board has a 20x20mm pattern of M3 mounting holes, so you can use nylon standoffs and M3 machine screws to attach it
to an acrylic panel for example.

This repository contains the KiCad project files and also a gerber zip that can be used to manufacture the board.
But if you are interested in this board, you can also find it in the 
[MobiFlight Community Shop](https://shop.mobiflight.com/product/dual-encoder-bundle) bundled with a resin printed
knob set. I recreated the board while learning to use KiCad, so this is slightly different in how it looks,
but it will replace the older stock in the shop once that runs out. 

Both variants are functionally identical.
